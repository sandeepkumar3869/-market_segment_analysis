The paragraphs that follow explore two possible avenues of action that McDonald's may pursue in terms of their marketing strategy. According to one strategy, McDonald's may perceive itself as servicing the whole market without having to take into account the disparities that exist among the different types of customers. On the other hand, one line of thought contends that McDonald's, despite its preeminent position in the market, stands to gain by investigating and capitalizing on the varying preferences of its customers via the implementation of a differentiated marketing strategy. It also highlights the parameters that management at McDonald's should examine while doing market research to determine which market segments have potential for success with their marketing plan. The homogeneity and uniqueness of the target segments, as well as their size, alignment with McDonald's strengths, identifiability, and reachability, are all aspects that go into determining whether or not a target segment meets these requirements. According to the information presented in the text, the most desirable demographic would be one that has a favorable impression of McDonald's, enjoys eating out often, and has a strong taste for fast food. However, the management may also work to strengthen their market presence among sectors that are less fond of McDonald's, with the goal of attempting to understand and correct the beliefs that are driving this feeling. According to the passage, since there is a lack of data in the case study of the fast food restaurant, the attractiveness of the segment will be determined by variables such as a person's affinity for McDonald's and the frequency with which they eat there. These factors play an essential part in the process of picking target segments for the strategy. The dataset contains the answers of 1,453 adult customers in Australia who were asked about their opinions on McDonald's based on characteristics such as YUMMY, CONVENIENT, SPICY, FATTENING, GREASY, FAST, CHEAP, TASTY, EXPENSIVE, HEALTHY, and DISGUSTING. Before conducting the poll, a qualitative investigation was conducted, and from it, these characteristics were gleaned. The respondents were asked to identify whether McDonald's had each quality, and they may choose to respond with either a YES or a NO. In addition to that, respondents disclosed information on their age as well as their gender. For the purpose of developing a more in-depth description of each market category, a true market segmentation research would have gathered more information, such as eating habits and the channels of information that individuals most often use.
